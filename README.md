It is based on the standard Azure App Service tutorial for Node.js.   

The database is relational with the schema specified in the sql/ sub-directory and is hosted on [ElephantSQL](https://customer.elephantsql.com/instance). The database server, user and password are stored as Azure application settings so that they arenâ€™t exposed in this (public) repo.

This data service is implemented for the client application [CalvinFinds](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-fall2023-teamA/client).
