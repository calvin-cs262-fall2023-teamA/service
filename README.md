# service

This is the data service application for the CalvinFinds project, which is deployed here:

[http://calvinfinds.azurewebsites.net/](http://calvinfinds.azurewebsites.net/)
It has the following data route URLs:

/ a hello message
/users a list of users
/users/:id a single user with the given ID
/items a list of items
/items/:id a single item with the given ID
It is based on the standard Azure App Service tutorial for Node.js.

The database is relational with the schema specified in the sql/ sub-directory and is hosted on ElephantSQL. The database server, user and password are stored as Azure application settings so that they arenâ€™t exposed in this (public) repo.
